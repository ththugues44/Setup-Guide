# On-Premise Signal Setup Guide

This guide is a community collaboration effort to setup on-premise (self-hosted) Signal Server.

*Signalâ„¢ is a trademark of Quiet Riddle Ventures LLC. This projects is not affliated with Signal.org, Signal Messenger LLC, nor Signal Foundation.*

## Requirements
* Twilio (For SMS OTP)
* Amazon Web Service (For Profile Picture / Avatar, Attachments, and CDS Queue. Can be subtituted with [MinIO](../master/signal-minio) & LocalStack)
* Firebase (For push notifications)
* Google Recaptcha (For anti-spam in authentication)

## Content
What's proven works
* [Signal Server](../master/signal-server)
* [Server dependencies: PostgreSQL & Redis](../master/signal-docker)
* [Turn Server](../master/turn-server)
* [Signal Android](../master/signal-android)
* [Signal iOS](../master/signal-ios)
* [Signal Desktop](../master/signal-desktop)

Work in progress
* Contact Discovery Service (CDS), you still can use your signal server without CDS.

## FAQ
Q: My chat only goes one way or can't send chat even when the server already set properly.

A: Probably caused by keystore haven't contain your SSL certificate / certificate did not match the url / you have not setup the Unidentified Delivery properly in the client. Will be explained in each guide of the server & clients.

Q: How to setup Turn Server? I can't do voice/video call.

A: Probably related to your port, either it is not allowed by the firewall or it is not properly set. See my example config on <a href="https://github.com/madecanggih/Setup-Guide/tree/master/coturn-server">Coturn Server<a/>

Q: Can I subtitute AWS to MinIO?

A: I tried it here <a href="https://github.com/madecanggih/Setup-Guide/tree/master/signal-minio">signal-minio</a> using modification created by <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/amazon-s3-component-replacement-for-text-secure-server-local-installation/5375/18">kondal789rao
</a>. Someone also did a pull request here: <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server/pull/76">Use MinIO instead of the AWS</a>. Also you can try to look into <a href="https://github.com/localstack/localstack">Localstack</a> for local development.

Q: Can I disable / change Twilio? (by getting the generated OTP on the server)

A: Yes, it is possible, you need to change TwilioSmsSender Class.

Q: Can I use Signal in localhost / internal IP / self-signed certificate (by trusting all certificate)

A: Yes, it is possible but it is not secure, see example on <a href="https://github.com/madecanggih/Setup-Guide/tree/master/signal-server-self-signed-certificate">Signal Server Self Signed Certificate</a>.

Q: Can I remove Google Mobile Service (GMS) from Signal?

A: Yes! A Signal user named "tx-hw" did it on their <a href="https://github.com/tw-hx/Signal-Android/tree/4.60.5.0-FOSS">Github Fork of Signal-Android</a>. You can read more about it on their <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/ive-removed-gms-from-the-signal-website-build-its-now-completely-open-source/14382">Signal Community Post</a>

## ToDos

* CDS Server: Find server with Intel SGX to try to setup custom CDS Server.
* Load Test: I want to see the performance of the custom server under stress, will update later.
